2) Apply many dimension reductions and clustering techniques
- Linear dimension reduction: PCA, NMF, ICA
- Nonlinear dimension reduction: UMAP, t-SNE
- Clustering: KMeans++, Spectral Clustering, ...

3) Take methods that work and gridsearch
- Evaluate best combination on stability, generalizibility, etc

4) Interpret results
